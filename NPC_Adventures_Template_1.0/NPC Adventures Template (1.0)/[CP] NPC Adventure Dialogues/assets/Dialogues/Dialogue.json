//Welcome to the Dialogue json! Below are *several* example lines for various places, vanilla and modded. You can add your own with relevant conditions!
//A fairly exhaustive list of conditions are in the docs at https://next.npcadventures.dev/docs/modding/dialogues . The below is mostly basic stuff.

//You have a choice at this point - you can put all the changes in this file, or you can make several jsons for different characters. If you do, return to content.json and write in the includes.
