//This is an optional custom foraging JSON. If your character is a forager, they will forage for items from a baseline list unless this JSON is defined.
//This particular example is Sandy's. She only forages flowers, a few regular forage items, and can get a user Magma Caps/Ginger on the Island.
//Quality Categories, if defined, will allow forages to be higher than regular quality. Use if you'd like higher value forages.
